To have a checklist of armors, weapons, and ashes of war for 100% trophy completetion.
The puropose is to have a nice visual layout to see instead of as an excel sheet.

This project is also to help me practice more on React, Tailwind, and learning how to use APIs (also UI design).

## Tech Stack

- React = JS framework
- Tailwind = CSS framework. Currently learning this
- Elden Ring API (https://docs.eldenring.fanapis.com/docs)
